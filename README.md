# Hello World App

This is a simple "Hello World" application built in Python, and it demonstrates how to set up a continuous deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions. **Solely, made for reference purpose.**

## Introduction

This "Hello World" app serves as a basic example of a project set up with GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will automatically deploy the latest code to the specified server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [GitHub Account](https://github.com/) - To host your project.
- [Server with SSH Access](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/deploying-to-servers-with-ssh) - To deploy your application.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your "Hello World" app up and running:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hello-world-app.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd hello-world-app
   ```

3. Customize the application or keep it as is for demonstration.

4. Push your changes to the `main` branch on GitHub:

   ```shell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Customize the Hello World message"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy the application to your server using the provided SSH key and secret. You can monitor the workflow in the GitHub Actions tab.

6. Access your "Hello World" app by visiting your server's URL.

## Workflow Details

The deployment process is automated using GitHub Actions. Here's a brief overview of the workflow steps:

- **Set up the environment:** The workflow runs on an Ubuntu machine and uses Python 3.x.

- **Install dependencies:** It installs the necessary Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

- **Deploy to server:** The deployment script is run on the server, copying the updated application files from GitHub.

- **Environment variables:** The `SERVER_URL` and `SECRET_KEY` environment variables are defined as secrets in your GitHub repository settings.
